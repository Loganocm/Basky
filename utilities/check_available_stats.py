Add these columns to your database for HUGE frontend improvements:

HIGH PRIORITY (Easy wins):
  - offensive_rebounds, defensive_rebounds (better than just total rebounds)
  - plus_minus (shows impact beyond stats)
  - fantasy_points (pre-calculated by NBA)
  - double_doubles, triple_doubles (achievement tracking)
  - personal_fouls (complete player profile)
  
MEDIUM PRIORITY (For calculations):
  - field_goals_made, field_goals_attempted
  - three_pointers_made, three_pointers_attempted
  - free_throws_made, free_throws_attempted
  - (These enable True Shooting %, Effective FG%, etc.)

LOW PRIORITY (Nice to have):
  - age, nickname
  - team_count (shows if player was traded)
  - personal_fouls_drawn
  - wins, losses while playing
