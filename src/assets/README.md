## Basketball Court Background

Please save the basketball court image as `basketball-court.jpg` or `basketball-court.png` in this folder.

The image will be automatically used as the background for the application.

Once the image is saved here, update the CSS reference in `global_styles.css` from the placeholder to:

```css
background-image: url("/assets/basketball-court.jpg");
```

or

```css
background-image: url("/assets/basketball-court.png");
```

depending on the image format you saved.
