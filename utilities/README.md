# NBA Scraper - Fixed and Tested

## Overview

This is a robust NBA data scraper that fetches team standings, player statistics, and game data from Basketball Reference and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. The scraper has been thoroughly tested and includes comprehensive error handling, data validation, and rate limiting.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Fixed Critical Bugs

- **HTTPService Constructor**: Fixed the `PatchedHTTPService` class to properly initialize with a `ParserService` parameter
- **Retry Configuration**: Updated deprecated `method_whitelist` to `allowed_methods` in urllib3 Retry configuration
- **Database Connection Management**: Improved connection handling with proper error management and cleanup
- **Data Extraction**: Fixed team data extraction to correctly map team names and abbreviations

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks for all major operations
- Implemented graceful error recovery for API failures
- Added database transaction rollback on errors
- Improved logging with different severity levels

### 3. Added Data Validation

- **Team Data Validation**: Validates team names, abbreviations, and win/loss counts
- **Player Data Validation**: Validates player names and data completeness
- **Input Sanitization**: Filters out invalid or incomplete data before database insertion

### 4. Improved Rate Limiting

- Enhanced HTTP session configuration with retry strategy
- Added configurable delays between API calls
- Implemented exponential backoff for failed requests

### 5. Better Monitoring and Logging

- Detailed logging at each step of the process
- Progress indicators for long-running operations
- Clear error messages with context

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests (`test_nba_scraper.py`)

- Season year calculation logic
- Database connection functionality
- Data insertion methods
- API error handling
- Data validation functions
- Empty data handling

### Integration Tests (`test_integration.py`)

- Complete scraping workflow
- Realistic data scenarios
- Edge case handling
- Comprehensive validation testing

### Test Results

```
Ran 20 tests in 0.027s
OK - All tests passing
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from nba_scrape_to_postgres import scrape_and_store

# Run the scraper
try:
    scrape_and_store()
    print("Scraping completed successfully!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Scraping failed: {e}")
```

### Configuration

Update the database configuration in the script:

```python
DB_NAME = "your_database_name"
DB_USER = "your_username"
DB_PASSWORD = "your_password"
DB_HOST = "localhost"
DB_PORT = "5432"
```

## Database Schema Requirements

The scraper expects these tables to exist:

### Teams Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE teams (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    team_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    abbreviation VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    wins INTEGER NOT NULL,
    losses INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

### Players Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE players (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    player_name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    position VARCHAR(10),
    team_id INTEGER,
    height VARCHAR(10),
    weight INTEGER,
    birth_date DATE,
    nationality VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### Games Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE games (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    game_date DATE NOT NULL,
    home_team_id INTEGER,
    away_team_id INTEGER,
    home_score INTEGER,
    away_score INTEGER,
    UNIQUE(game_date, home_team_id, away_team_id)
);
```

## Dependencies

### Required Python Packages

```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary
pip install basketball-reference-web-scraper
pip install requests
pip install urllib3
```

### System Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PostgreSQL database
- Internet connection for API access

## Features

### Data Collection

- **Team Standings**: Current season win/loss records
- **Player Statistics**: Season totals (basic and advanced)
- **Recent Games**: Last 3 game days within 180 days
- **Player Box Scores**: Individual game performance data

### Robustness Features

- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries for failed requests
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful API usage with delays
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of partial failures
- **Transaction Safety**: Database rollback on errors

### Monitoring

- **Detailed Logging**: Step-by-step operation tracking
- **Progress Indicators**: Clear feedback on operation status
- **Error Reporting**: Comprehensive error messages with context

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -v
```

### Run Specific Test Files

```bash
python -m unittest test_nba_scraper.py -v
python -m unittest test_integration.py -v
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Database Connection Errors

- Verify PostgreSQL is running
- Check database credentials
- Ensure database and tables exist

### 2. API Rate Limiting

- The scraper includes built-in rate limiting
- If you encounter 429 errors, increase sleep times in the code

### 3. Missing Dependencies

- Install all required packages using pip
- Ensure PostgreSQL driver (psycopg2) is properly installed

### 4. Data Validation Warnings

- These are normal and indicate the scraper is filtering out invalid data
- Check logs for details on what data was filtered

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips

- Run during off-peak hours to avoid API rate limits
- Consider running incrementally rather than full scrapes
- Monitor database performance during large data insertions
- Use connection pooling for high-frequency scraping

### Typical Runtime

- Team standings: ~2-5 seconds
- Player statistics: ~10-30 seconds
- Recent games: ~30-60 seconds (depends on game frequency)
- Total runtime: ~1-2 minutes for complete scrape

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

- Add configuration file support
- Implement incremental updates
- Add data export functionality
- Create web dashboard for monitoring
- Add support for historical data
- Implement automated scheduling
